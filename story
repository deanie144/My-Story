Jack climbed the long beanstalk to try and steal a gold plate from the Giant but the giant woke up. The giant chased Jack and Jack ran as fast as he could to the beanstalk so the Giant wouldn't catch him and eat him up. Jack climbed down the beanstalk, while the Giant was still running to try and get to the beanstalk but Jack managed to escape in time. Jack got home safely and his brother was relieved that he got home.
